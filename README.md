# CHIP-8 Emulator

Hobby side project to implement a CHIP-8 emulator in Rust. Currently uses SDL2 to handle audio, input, and video display.

### TODO

* SCHIP and XO-CHIP support
* Other audio/input/video systems
  * Add a "bundle" system to group related drivers together (e.g SDL)
* Accurate timing
* Debug capability (stepping, pausing, memory visualizer, etc)
